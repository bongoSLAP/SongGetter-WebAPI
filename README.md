# SongGetter-WebAPI
backend for SongGetter using .NET framework and YoutubeExplode library

bug:
audio wont post to client perhaps because the encoding is not actually mpeg, just because it is saved with .mp3 extension doesnt neccesarily mean it is mpeg encoded.
the file downloaded cannot be opened in a program such as fl studio probably becuase of this reason
